Explain why the statement, “The running time of algorithm A is at least $O(n^2)$,” is meaningless.

A:

- "The running time of algorithm A is $O(n^2)$" means the running time has an **upper bound** which is $O(n^2)$
- "The running time of algorithm A is **at least** $T$" means the runing time has an **lower bound** which is $T$

those two are opposite.
